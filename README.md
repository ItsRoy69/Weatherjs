Weather.js

==========

​


## About

​

There really should be a conclusive Javascript weather library. Weather.js fetches data from [openweathermap.org][] (no affiliation).
 Since other providers format their output differently, currently this is the only source provider.

​
Weather.js is still in early development so expect changes and please contribute! Among the features I hope to incorporate:

​

-   historical weather information

-   API key usage

-   more data sources

-   more conversions!

​

​

## Install

​

Weather.js works in the browser and node.js. Take your pick. For the browser, [download the most recent version on github][Weather.js]. For use in node, do the install [Hyper] .
